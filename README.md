# Building up experimental things

This project is intended for learning purposes by putting in practice the web-animations-api and building things up with the powerful capabilities of HTML5.

Go ahead and feel free to fork it. Maybe you're gonna learn something new too :)

## Project structure

The `index.html` file stores a table listing all the available demos, each one with its own link. 
Just launch a simple server at the root of the project and start exploring it.

`polyfill.js` is the [web-animations-api](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js) polyfill.

`template.html` is a basic html template to start creating a demo.

The `styles` folder contains the base styles of every page.

The `demos` folder contains all the demo subfolders listed on the `index.html` table.
